Foot Patrol to Operate as Delivery Service
By: Jonathan Marshall on September 11, 2015
Students who sign up for the Emergency Notification Service on Carleton Central now have the
option to request deliveries from the volunteer resource Foot Patrol.
The mission was started this year, stemming from the idea that most students cannot manage
the task of foraging for food each day by themselves.
“The prospect of having to walk five minutes, or in extreme cases even 10, to find a Starbucks is
terrifying”, says Bradley Pitt, second year economics major.
The walking­delivery service will cover not only campus, but the whole city. Many local
businesses in the Byward Market have already signed on to the idea, offering orderers a 30
minutes­or­less delivery time guarantee.
Many have found that the Foot Patrol, which previously has served as a Safe­Space escort
service, was far too well­respected and appreciated for the not­for­profit time and energy of it’s
members.
“What, just because you’re there to protect me from bodily and mental harm, able/willing to
perform life­saving techniques on me, and volunteering away hours of your free time, I’m
supposed to recognize you as a peer?”, remarks first­year Robyn Fenty, major undeclared.
The Foot Patrol has released a statement regarding their pick­ups, that as they are
volunteer­based, their members should not be tipped or thanked in anyway, quote “They know
what they signed up for.”
They also reminded students that their service is for food only. Should they need any other
‘consumables’ discreetly delivered, nefarious or otherwise, Campus Security is more than willing
to accommodate your needs. Simply provide your name, student number and the address your
package is to be received from.
The service was sparked by several concerns of students spilling hot food on themselves,
getting lost in the tunnels, or talking to strangers. The new program will amend these problems
and also limit the number of students who are “walking freely”, a bane Carleton has been
troubled with for many years.
“They’re everywhere,” fourth year english major Thomas Hanks complains, “they cause traffic in
the hallways, the stairs and doors.”
Well, quoth the Raven, nevermore.
