From: Arnold Schadenreudenston, 21, Germany

Dear Hitler's Mustache,
I gave my friend a gold star for his excellent effort in math class, but he refuses to wear it! What can I do to convince him?

Dear Arnold,
Your friend may be concerned with how it would affect his look and style. Show him he can look sleek and elegant by finding pictures online of other people wearing gold stars and looking great doing it!

Sincerely, HM
