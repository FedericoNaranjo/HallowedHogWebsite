From: Harry Smith,43, Texas

Dear Hitler's Mustache,
I'm having a problem with my accountant, he seems to think my bank is using compound interest, as opposed to simple interest. How do I talk some sense into him?

Dear Harry,
I'm sorry to hear about your accounting troubles. Unfortunately, as a mustache I have no idea what that means, nor why you'd be messaging a mustache across the world for advice on this. However, I would recommend the accountant be sent to a camp where he learn to concentrate on his accounting better.

Sincerely, HM
